On computers, the term traceroute is a computer network analysis tool that specifies the route that a packet of information passes from your network to a specific network specified in the tracert command (the address of a website or IP address). How It Works? The path is found by sending three ICMP messages to the destination with low Time to Live (TTL) field values. Each router on the way to the destination reduces the value in this field by 1 while passing the message on. If the router sees that the field value is zero, it sends an error type ICMP message back to the sender. The sender raises the initial value of the TTL (starting from 1) each time so that it eventually stops when it receives an ICMP type of success from the destination address. The average amount of times per hop, this is the time it took before we were able to communicate with the destination address. Geo-traceroute does not show the IP addresses of the routers through which the package passes like the traceroute tool. Rather, it uses this tool to turn the route from an IP-type track into a visual track that allows you to see the geographical location of these addresses on the map of the world In the end, this route is the route that the package passed until it reached its destination.
